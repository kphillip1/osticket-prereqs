- Before you complete the form, you'll need a database client.
- Install HeidiSQL.
- Open HeidiSQL and create a new database using the name and password you created for MySQL.

- Click install now.
- Browse to your help desk login page: http://localhost/osTicket/scp/login.php. There's a little bit of cleanup necessary before you proceed.
- Delete: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\setup.
- Set permissions to “Read, Read and execute" at : C:\inetpub\wwwroot\osTicket\include\ost-config.php.
